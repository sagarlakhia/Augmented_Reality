This is an Augmented Reality application.
The application detects a pattern and tries to project an image in the image lens.
The porgramming language used is C++ and libraries used are opencv and Arma Library.

I'd like to thank Georgios Evangelidis,  for his work on detecting the model and projecting the cube
